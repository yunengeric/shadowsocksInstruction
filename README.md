## About Shadowsocks

> - Shadowsocks is an open-source encrypted proxy project, Typically, the client software will open a socks5 proxy on the machine it is run, which internet traffic can then be directed towards, similarly to an SSH tunnel.
> - Shadowsocks uses a self-designed protocol for secure communications. The encryption algorithms include AES, Blowfish, IDEA, and RC4. No handshaking is needed except for creating a TCP connection. Each request only forwards one connection and does not need to maintain the state of “always connected”, so it is relatively power-efficient on mobile devices. All traffic is algorithmically encrypted, allowing you to choose your own algorithm.
> - Clients are available on multiple major operating systems and platforms, including Windows, OSX, Android, Linux, and iOS systems and routers (OpenWrt).
